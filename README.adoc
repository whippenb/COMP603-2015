== May 8: Introduction

NOTE: Please read http://www.ethoberon.ethz.ch/WirthPubl/CBEAll.pdf[Chapters 1, 2 and 3 (Pages 6-16)]
or Chapters 1, 2 and 3 of the Crafting a Compiler textbook by next week.
If this is overwhelming, read the first sentence of each paragraph,
then skip subsequent sentences if it made sense, otherwise read on.

=== What is the difference between a set, a bag, and a sequence?

These are all collections.

A *set* is unordered and has no duplicates (no repeated values).

----
{ "hello", "world" } == { "world", "hello" }
----

A *bag* is unordered and allows duplicates (repeated values).

----
{ "buffalo", "my", "buffalo" } == { "my", "buffalo", "buffalo" }
----

A *sequence* is ordered and allows duplicates.

----
[ "hello", "cruel", "world" ] != [ "cruel", "world", "hello" ]
----

An *ordered set* is ordered and has no duplicates.

To summarize:

=== What is a language in terms of sets and sequences?

English subset

----
{
    "This is a sentence in English.",
    "This is another sentence in English."
}
----

Espanol subseto?

----
{
    "Yo quiero Taco Bell",
    "Donde esta el bano?"
}
----

An *alphabet* is a set of symbols (e.g., `char`).
A *string* is a sequence of symbols chosen from some alphabet.

*Languages* are (possibly infinite) sets of strings.
A *grammar* constructs a language; *regular expressions* construct *regular* languages.

=== What is a compiler? Name some.

A *compiler* transforms source language into a target language.

javac, gcc, clang, etc.

=== What is an interpreter? How does that differ from a compiler?

An *interpreter* accepts code and runtime data and runs with it.
We're not generating code.

== May 7: Git setup and prequiz

=== Install Git and frontends

[[install-git]]
Windows:: http://sourceforge.net/projects/gitextensions/[Install Git Extensions]
+
NOTE: Install MsysGit, Install KDiff, and *choose OpenSSH* (not PuTTY); otherwise,
stick to the default settings.
+

image:http://lawrancej.github.io/starterupper/images/openssh.png[Choose OpenSSH]

Mac OS X:: http://rowanj.github.io/gitx/[Install GitX-dev], then https://developer.apple.com/xcode/downloads/[Install XCode developer tools] which ships with git (recommended) or http://git-scm.com/download/mac[install git from here].

Linux:: http://git-scm.com/download/linux[Install git] using your package manager.
http://sourceforge.net/projects/qgit/[QGit, a git frontend] may also be available for your distribution.
+
NOTE: Don't forget to use +sudo+ with your package manager.

=== Run starterupper

Starterupper sets up git and project hosting for this class;
it is safe to run even if you already have git and SSH keys set up on your machine.

Open Git Bash (Windows) or Terminal (Linux, Mac OS X) and paste in the command below.
Press `Insert` to paste in Git Bash.

----
curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lawrancej/COMP603-2015/master/main.sh | bash
----

=== Complete the prequiz

Open up `prequiz.adoc` in your favorite text editor (it is in your local git repository).

WARNING: Do not use Notepad or Word.
Use a real text editor. Suggestions:
http://notepad-plus-plus.org/download/v6.7.7.html[Notepad++] (Windows),
https://atom.io/[Atom],
or http://www.sublimetext.com/[Sublime].

Then, save your changes and submit your work to your repository.
