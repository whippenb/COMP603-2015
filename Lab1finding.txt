1. CPython

2. 
tokenize: tokenizer.py
parse: parse folder has multiple files
AST: Python.asdl
Optimization: py_compile.py
code generation: genobject.c

3. The most surprising thing is that nearly the whole thing is written in c

4. cpython seems to be quite large
some names tell you a lot, some names tell you nothing
so many things have "Py" in the name
They have a base level file just for a single file about grammar
Most of the stuff from part 2 is in the Parser base file
The whole thing has a lot of contributors
The programs file has very few actual files, but does have the surprisingly short python.c file.
python.c seems to be mostly just setup.  
PCbuild seems to be just a whole bunch of stuff to help python work under the varied pc conditions and with various other PC softwares like sql
